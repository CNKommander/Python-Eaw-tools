This is a collection of python based utilities for usage with the game Empire At War Forces Of Corruption developed by Kiwi
You can use the source code of these tools for anything you wish, so long as some credit is given, fair warning however most of these tools have rather messy source code

There are 3 pieces of software in this bundle in each folder
Each folder contains the source code, and an executable for running them
The Executables DO NOT REQUIRE PYTHON to run

The First Tool is under the folder DatEditor - credit to Jorrit for his freely available dat compiler of which some of the code for this is based off of
The name is fairly self explanatory this is a piece of software designed to edit Petryoglyph text files
after opening the executable go to File->Open to open a dat file, the table will then fill, to edit an identifier or string double click on it
To search through the dat file type something into the search bar, then press the search icon
to add a new text string go to New-> Text String, this will create an empty cell at the top of the table for you to edit
to save the dat file, go to File->Save or Save As

The Second piece of software here is under the folder ModLauncher
this is a fairly self explanatory piece of software
it is capable of launching mods, and submods for Empire At War Forces Of Corruption, as well as installing its debug build
and adding extra launch parameters, and creating shortcuts for mod launching

The final tool in this bundle is under the folder PlanetDataTool
This tool is a planet placement tool with the ability to change other planet details as well
after launching select the Data Folder of any mod, you will then be greeted by the main UI for the application
